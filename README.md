# Federalist Papers NLP 

This repository includes a thorough analysis of U.S. Police Fatalities. I will use a variety of exploratory and modeling techniques to answer the following questions:  

- How many people have been killed by police over time?
- What is the race/age/gender of these people?
- What are the demographics of the offending police officers?
- What are the demographics of the general population in which the incident   occurred? This includes the political affiliations of the mayor, city council, and the presidential candidate that the city voted for in 2016.
  
The repository is organized as follows:  

| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Code | This section includes all of the R code used on the U.S. Police-caused Fatalities dataset. |
| Data | This section includes the main datasets used throughout the analyses. |


### Note about the Data  
In this analysis, I'll be working with a few datasets. Different datasets include different ranges of time for police fatalities, with some overlap. On top of that, I have some census, incident, and subject data. The data runs from **2000-2020**, which makes it an extremely expansive dataset of police-caused fatalities/killings over the *past 20 years*.
