# Federalist Papers NLP 
This repository includes a thorough text analysis of [The Federalist Papers](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text).  The Federalist Papers is a series of 85 essays written by Founding Fathers Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison before the ratification of the Constitution.
There are many interesting applications of advanced text analysis, or Natural Language Processing (NLP), that can be applied to the Federalist Papers. In particular, this project aims to do the following:

 - Basic text analysis of the papers (word count, document length, etc.)
 - Text summarization to more quickly understand the content of each paper
 - Topic modelling to create logical groupings of the papers 
 - Author identification to try to classify who wrote which papers (the authors of about 20 of the papers are still not known to this day)
 - Create an app to allow individuals to live-interact with some of the above analytics
 - Generalize the app beyond just The Federalist Papers!

The repository is organized as follows:
